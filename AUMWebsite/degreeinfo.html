        <p>The Department of Computer Science and Computer Information Systems offers exciting and high-quality bachelor’s degrees in computer science, along with master’s degrees in cybersystems and information security.The College of Sciences offers students a scientific education to meet the needs of the 21st century, allowing them to compete for a variety of careers in an increasingly complex and evolving world.Auburn University at Montgomery’s Master of Science in Computer Science will prepare you for a growing industry and position you for leadership opportunities in industry, government, academia and the research sector. </p>
        
        <h2><left>Undergraduate Programs</left></h2>
        <b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</b><br>

<p>Computer science is a relatively new discipline. In general, it is a science of using computers to solve problems. It is not about using software. High Performance Computing is the main theme of this degree program. In addition to obtaining general computer science training, you will learn multi-core architectures and programming.</p>


        <h2><left>Graduate Programs</left></h2>
        <b>Master of Science in Computer Science</b><br>

        <p>The master’s degree program in computer science will give students specialized preparation in the broad area of computer science with a choice of four concentrations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>General Computer Science</li>
        <li>High Performance Computing</li>
        <li>Data Analytics</li>
        <li>Computer and Cybersystems Security</li><br>
    </ul>
        
        <p>After graduation students can advance their careers as computer professionals by taking various job positions in the computing industry, research centers, government and academia.</p>
        <p> Our graduates will also have the theoretical and practical preparation necessary to continue their education in doctoral programs focusing on the areas of computer science, computational science, modeling and simulation and applied mathematics. </p>
       
        <h2>Master of Computer Information Systems and Cybersecurity</h2>

        <p>This degree program prepares students to become leaders in the field of information and network security, offering instruction and research opportunities that provide graduates with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively assess, develop, and manage secure information networks and to respond to newly developed threats. Graduates often find career opportunities in information technology, homeland security, government and state agencies, private business and the armed forces.</p>
